# My First Post

Published on: April 30th, 2024

Welcome to my *new blog* about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

### What I've Learned So Far

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.
2. **Making a Page**: I've edited template code as well as made and published a few pages fully on my own.
3. **A First 'Blog-type' Post**: Which is this page being viewed here.

### What's Next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
